# SQL-Project---Data-Analysis-Jobs
## Introduction

Focusing on data analyst job roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

This project was build for my course SQL for Data Analytics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA) by Luke Barousse.

Thank you so much Luke!
